## Recapitulação sobre _functions_
<sub>124. Recapping Functions Knowledge - What We Know Thus Far</sub>

Nota no 125:

  _Throughout this course, you'll hear me use the words "parameters" and "arguments" interchangeably._

  _Technically, there is a difference though:_

  _Parameters are these variables which you specify between parentheses when defining a function._

  _function sayHi(name) { ... } 
  In this example, name is a parameter._

  _Arguments then are the concrete values you pass to a function when calling that function:_

  _sayHi('Max');_
  _'Max' is an argument of the function therefore - for the name parameter to be precise._

  _Since both concepts obviously are extremely close connected, I will often say "let's define which arguments a function receives" or something comparable, since defining the arguments of a function in the end means that you set up its parameters (and vice-versa)._
